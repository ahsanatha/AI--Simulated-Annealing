## Simulated Annealing
This is a homework project from my study group AI laboratory. Kindly read about [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)

## Breakdown
This project are my initial version.
the purpose of this project is to find the lowest result of this function :
![function](https://github.com/ahsanatha/AI-Simulated-Annealing/blob/master/img/function.png)

Initial Temperature is 2000000000000.
and The Cooling Rate is 0.5

### Hypothesis
i assume that if you make Cooling rate Greater than 0.5 you will make the program infinity loop.
Because we are using float as variable type.


## Result
![result](https://github.com/ahsanatha/AI-Simulated-Annealing/blob/master/img/Result.png)

## Conclusion
So, if you try to run this program repeatedly, you will realize that the answer is always around
```
-0.043
```
so i jumped into my conlusion that the minimum result is **-0.043**
